       The Research department is key to Aidspan's role as analyst and explainer of the Global Fundâ€™s systems, processes and outcomes. With a strategic aim (2014-2016) to increase understanding and provide feedback on the New Funding Model (NFM) to strengthen the roll-out process and make it more effective, the Research team produces working papers, peer reviewed articles, reviews, reports and analyses of the processes, effectiveness and impact of the Global Fund and its activities.

Aidspan relies on a small team of in-house researchers and external collaborators with expertise in health economics, epidemiology, governance, health systems strengthening, and Global Fund processes among others. Aidspan is developing collaborations with research institutions and other policy- focused organizations. We are currently developing an internship program to develop the capacities of young researchers from East Africa.

Aidspan research publications aim to provide accurate unbiased results that can be used by governments, NGOs, researchers, and donors. All Aidspan publications are open access. We welcome suggestions for articles and research collaborations.
